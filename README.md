<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This repository is dedicated to my personal learning and training journey. I will be working with various technologies, including TensorFlow, Python, and Keras, and plan to expand it with other tools in the future. Your contributions and advice are always welcome, so feel free to pull requests or share your suggestions to enhance my learning process.

  Additionally, I am developing a project practice section where I will be showcasing my hands-on projects. I value your input and feedback, so if you have any advice or recommendations related to my projects, I would highly appreciate it.

  Together, let's grow and learn in the exciting world of data science, machine learning, and technology!
